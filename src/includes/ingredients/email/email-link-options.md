#### Making regular Branch links compatible with email

Be sure to add `"$3p":"e_xx"` to the deep link data of any links you use in email to ensure Universal Link and click tracking works as expected.

#### Create email links via API without changing your email templates

To create email links via API, please use the instructions on how to [create links via API](/pages/apps/api/#link-create), but include the following key value pairs in your call:

1. `"$3p":"e_xx"` This is required for Universal Link and click tracking functionality.
1. `"$original_url":"{{your web url URI encoded}}"` For each piece of content, include a URI encoded version of your content's web URL. You can also add deep link data as query parameters on that web URL. This ensures accurate Content Analytics reporting. 
   **Example:** `"$original_url":"https%3A%2F%2Fshop.com%2Fshoes%2Fbrown-shoes%3Fmy_key%3Dmy_value%26campaign%3Dshoe_discounts"`

#### Convert all web links in your email to deep links

We have provided a way of easily converting web links to Branch links, as well as [an example](https://gist.github.com/derrickstaten/f9b1e72e506f79628ab9127dd114dd83#file-sendgrid-demo-js). The example takes an html email (as a string) and applies the script to it.

Here is the script:

```javascript
var crypto = require('crypto');
module.exports = function(original_url, branch_base_url) {
    if (!original_url) { return new Error('Missing original_url'); }
    if (typeof original_url != 'string') { return new Error('Invalid original_url'); }
    if (!branch_base_url) { return new Error('Missing branch_base_url, should be similar to https://bnc.lt/abcd/3p?%243p=e_xx'); }
    if (typeof branch_base_url != 'string') { return new Error('Invalid branch_base_url'); }

    return branch_base_url + '&%24original_url=' + encodeURIComponent(original_url);
};
```

Here is how links look before and after (the latter being a Branch deep link).

1. *Before:* http://example.com/?foo=bar
2. *After:* https://vza3.app.link/3p?%243p=e_xx&%24original_url=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2F%3Ffoo%3Dbar

**Note** that these are simplified examples, not actual demo links.
