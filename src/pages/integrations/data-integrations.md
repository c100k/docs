## Overview

Data Integrations provide an easy way to automatically send Branch data to your other analytics services and marketing tools using pre-formatted webhooks. For most integrations, configuration just requires you to input your credentials and hit “Enable”.

!!! note "Data Feeds is a premium solution"
    Data Integrations are included in Branch’s [Data Feeds](/pages/exports/data-feeds/) offering, which can be purchased according to Branch’s [pricing schedule](https://branch.io/pricing/){:target="\_blank"}, and is available at no additional charge to customers who are on MAU plans for [Journeys](https://branch.io/journeys/){:target="\_blank"}, [Deep Linked Email](https://branch.io/email/){:target="\_blank"}, or [Universal Ads](https://branch.io/attribution/){:target="\_blank"}. Without Data Feeds, you can still export Branch data in CSV form directly from the Branch dashboard via [Sources](https://dashboard.branch.io/sources){:target="\_blank"} or [CSV Exports](https://dashboard.branch.io/data-import-export/csv-exports){:target="\_blank"}.
