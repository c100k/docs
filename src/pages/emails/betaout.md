Please reach out to Betaout support to request a new custom tracking domain for your account. To enable tracking on a subdomain, you must set up a CNAME record in DNS pointing your subdomain to emailbout.com. 

Once you have a custom tracking domain, enter it on the Configure ESP step of email onboarding. On **Done** click, an AASA file - required for Universal Links - specific to that domain will be generated.
