On **Done** click, an AASA file - required for Universal Links - specific to that domain will be generated.

#### Validate your click tracking domain in SendGrid

Before you CNAME to Branch, you must CNAME your click tracking domain to sendgrid.net and validate the domain in Whitelabel > Email Links within SendGrid. Once there is a green checkmark indicating that the domain is valid, then you can proceed to the next step.

## Troubleshoot issues

- ### Error validating whitelabel: Expect CNAME record
    If you are seeing this [error message](/img/pages/email/sendgrid/sendgrid_error.png), the reason is that SendGrid will only consider the CNAME sendgrid.net valid. To get rid of this error, please:

    1. CNAME your subdomain to sendgrid.net
    1. Validate records on SendGrid dashboard
    1. CNAME your subdomain to thirdparty.bnc.lt
    1. Do not validate records on SendGrid after Step 3
