## Setup

!!! warning "Prerequisites"
	* [x] To track installs from Google Ads you should [integrate the Branch SDK](/pages/apps/ios/#integrate-branch) into your app.
	* [x] If you want to deep link from your ads directly to content, you should [configure deep link routing](/pages/deep-linking/routing/).
	* [x] Ads is a premium product priced on Monthly Active Users. Sign up for the Ads product to enable this functionality.

### Feed Creation

#### Manual Method

If you need more customization for any reason, you can also convert your feed manually.

1. Tell your Branch account manager, or support@branch.io, that you'd like to use Google Shopping Ads so they can enable your account. 
1. Find your Branch base domain by going to the [Link Settings Page](https://branch.dashboard.branch.io/link-settings) of your Branch Dashboard.

1. Take the link in the `link` column of your existing product feed, and URL encode it.
1. Prepend the encoded link from the previous step with your Branch base domain and the following parameters:
```3p?$3p=a_google_adwords&~advertising_partner_name=Google%20AdWords&~campaign_id={campaignid}&~ad_set_id={adgroupid}&~keyword_text={keyword}&~placement={placement}&$original_url=```

For example, if your Branch base domain was `example.app.link`, your initial link:

```https://www.example.com/?foo=bar```

Would become:

```https://example.app.link/3p?$3p=a_google_adwords&~advertising_partner_name=Google%20AdWords&~campaign_id={campaignid}&~ad_set_id={adgroupid}&~keyword_text={keyword}&~placement={placement}&$original_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.example.com%2F%3Ffoo%3Dbar&~campaign=GoogleShoppingCampaign```

Finally, replace the column `adwords_redirect` in your feed with the resulting link (create the column if it is absent). Repeat for each row in your feed.

!!! note "Include all link data"
    If you want to track analytics in Branch, and you want to deep link to specific content in the app, be sure to append all necessary parameters, including deep link data and analytics tags, to the end of the link as URI encoded query parameters. In the example above, the customer uses `$original_url` as their deep link key, and `~campaign` to set the campaign name that will appear in analytics.

Now that you have your feed, it's time to upload it to Google Merchant Center and use it in an Adwords Campaign.

### Using Your Feed

!!! warning "Prerequisites"
	* [x] Be sure you have both a Google Adwords account, and a Google Merchant Center account, and that the two accounts are linked.
